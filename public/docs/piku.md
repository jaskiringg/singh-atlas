# PIKU — Local-First AI Workspace

**Status:** Active development · IndexedDB v8 · Tauri 2 desktop shell  
**Thesis:** The model is replaceable; the understanding should not be. PIKU is an ambient operating layer that accumulates a private **World Model** of your work, relationships, and decisions — not another stateless chat window.

---

## 1. Problem

Modern AI assistants optimize for **turn-level fluency**, not **life-level continuity**. Each session starts cold. Context must be re-explained. Project history, decision rationale, and cross-tool signals (mail, calendar, commits) stay siloed in the apps that generated them.

For someone who owns systems end-to-end — discovery through production support — this gap is structural:

| Pain | Why chatbots fail |
|------|-------------------|
| **Context amnesia** | No durable store of who you are, what you're building, or why a decision was made |
| **Tool fragmentation** | Gmail, GitHub, Jira, and local files each hold partial truth; no unified query surface |
| **Privacy vs capability** | Cloud models reason well but exfiltrate context; local models are private but weak on hard asks |
| **Interrupt cost** | Full-screen chat pulls you out of flow; ambient work needs lightweight invocation |

PIKU treats **memory and structure as the product**. Inference is a swappable engine. The World Model — graph + embeddings + project context + extracted facts — is what compounds over months and years.

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Local-first persistence** — All World Model data (memories, graph, projects, agent sessions) lives on-device in versioned IndexedDB. Works offline for retrieval and local inference.
2. **Ambient availability** — Global hotkey (⌥+Space) opens a minimal quick-ask overlay; the main shell is a navigable OS with dedicated surfaces for work domains.
3. **Structured memory** — Dual stores: a **fact memory** layer (categorized, confidence-gated) and a **knowledge graph** (~9 node types, ~10 relationship types) with hybrid retrieval.
4. **Context engineering per turn** — Every user message triggers parallel World Model query + conversation summary retrieval before the brain sees the prompt. Dynamic context is appended; static persona prefix stays byte-stable for KV-cache reuse.
5. **Agent workflows with real tools** — Agent mode routes through a tool-capable path: open apps, check mail/calendar, query GitHub, search web, read home directory, save/recall memory.
6. **User sovereignty** — Settings → Privacy → **Local-only** disables the optional cloud reasoning path (ADR-006). Embeddings and tool execution remain local regardless.
7. **Extensible observation** — Connectors (GitHub, Gmail, Google Calendar) and an active-app observer (Rust, consent-gated) feed the observation loop; new sources implement a `ContextSource` registry interface.

### Non-Goals

| Non-goal | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **General-purpose chatbot** | No "new conversation" product loop; sessions are contexts tied to projects and the graph |
| **Cloud-hosted SaaS** | No multi-tenant backend; optional cloud brain is user-controlled and proxied locally |
| **Autonomous agent without confirmation** | Consequential World Model writes and external actions require user approval or explicit tool invocation |
| **Replacing Gmail/GitHub/Jira** | PIKU orchestrates and summarizes; embedded panels and deep links, not full replacements |
| **Personality-as-data (yet)** | Settings UI exists; declarative persona files are roadmap, not shipped |

---

## 3. Users & Primary Surfaces

**Primary user:** A technical operator (developer, architect, founder) who juggles multiple projects, identities (work/personal), and tools — and wants one private layer that remembers context across all of them.

Navigation is fixed in the sidebar — fourteen surfaces, each a domain over the same World Model:

| # | Surface | Role |
|---|---------|------|
| 01 | **Home** | Dashboard: greeting, ambient ask bar, project snapshot, World Model node count, today's connector feed, system status |
| 02 | **Agent** | Multi-session control hub: named contexts, live reasoning panel, tool trace, project linking, sticky approach modes |
| 03 | **Models** | Local Ollama model picker, opencode deep-brain status, manual handoff to external assistants (user's own accounts) |
| 04 | **Projects** | CRUD for tracked projects: vision, state, in-progress work, blockers, decisions; links to project galaxy in Knowledge |
| 05 | **Knowledge** | Force-directed graph visualization ("cosmic void" theme); galaxy clustering by project/core/brainstorm |
| 06 | **Datasets** | Inventory dashboard: project count, graph stats, model list, memory totals, project-brain vault entries |
| 07 | **Apps** | Embedded comms: WhatsApp/LinkedIn native webviews, Gmail widget; all inside the shell |
| 08 | **Work** | Git identity switcher, GitHub commit feed, Jira/Confluence/Notion deep links via Piku Chrome profile |
| 09 | **Files** | Sandboxed home-directory browser (read-only `list_dir` via Tauri) |
| 10 | **Calendar** | Merged Google Calendar from connected accounts; work/personal filter |
| 11 | **People** | Person nodes from graph with relationship edges surfaced as cards |
| 12 | **Playground** | Experimental graph/brain inspection surface |
| 13 | **Automations** | User-defined instruction + trigger phrases; capability registry mirroring ToolRouter |
| 14 | **Settings** | Profile (operator name, work/personal email & GitHub), model selection, privacy toggle, connector OAuth, work-tool URLs |

Home and Agent share the same session store (`agentHub`) — a turn on Home is visible in Agent and vice versa.

## 5. System Architecture

PIKU follows a **layered ambient OS** model: shell chrome, chat/reasoning, graph/memory, World Model query, and apps/connectors.

```

**Trust boundaries:**

- **Always local:** IndexedDB, embeddings, ToolRouter execution, connector token storage, file listing under home.
- **User-opt-out cloud:** Conversation + reasoning text routed to opencode proxy when Local-only is off. Context is assembled locally first; only the assembled turn leaves the machine.
- **User-owned OAuth:** Gmail/GitHub/Calendar tokens are per-account, stored locally, never sent to a PIKU server (there isn't one).

---

## 6. Memory → Retrieve Sequence

Every chat turn runs context retrieval **before** inference. This is the core context-engineering loop — not a RAG bolt-on.

```

**Retrieval signals (conceptual — not exact weights):**

| Store | Keyword match | Semantic similarity | Structural |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| Memories | Term overlap on content | Cosine vs query embedding | Importance, recency, access count |
| Graph nodes | Term overlap on name/type | Cosine vs node embedding | Edge connectivity bonus |
| Projects | Term overlap on vision/state | Semantic on project fields | Linked decisions, blockers |

Confirmed memories require high extraction confidence; pending memories are stored for review but **excluded from retrieval** to prevent pollution.

---

## 7. Conceptual Data Model

### IndexedDB stores (v8)

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `memories` | Atomic user facts with category, confidence, importance, embedding |
| `summaries` | Rolling conversation narratives with embeddings |
| `conversations` | Full verbatim chat history (legacy path) |
| `agentContexts` | Named Agent sessions with turns, optional project link, sticky mode |
| `projects` | Tracked work: vision, state, work lists, embedded decisions |
| `pendingProjectUpdates` | Extraction proposals awaiting review |
| `contextVersions` | Immutable project snapshots after approved updates |
| `graphNodes` | Typed entities with optional 768-dim embedding |
| `graphEdges` | Directed relationships with strength + confirmed/pending status |

Settings (`pikuSettings`) live in **localStorage**, not IndexedDB — identity, models, privacy flag, work-tool URLs. Embedding model is intentionally **not** user-editable (vector invalidation risk).

### Graph ontology (~9 node types)

| Type | Represents |
|------|------------|
| `project` | A body of work PIKU tracks |
| `goal` | Long-horizon objective |
| `skill` | Capability area |
| `person` | Someone in the operator's world |
| `memory` | Graph-anchored fact node |
| `decision` | Recorded choice with rationale |
| `repository` | Code repo reference |
| `technology` | Tool, framework, or platform |
| `concept` | Domain or architectural concept |

### Graph relationships (~10 types)

`depends_on` · `supports` · `blocks` · `caused_by` · `related_to` · `owned_by` · `uses` · `supersedes` · `implements` · `part_of`

Edges carry **strength** (0–1) and **status**. High-confidence extractions auto-confirm; weaker edges stay pending until reinforced.

### Memory categories (13)

Personal facts, relationships, preferences, goals, ongoing projects, important dates, corrections, habits, achievements, skills, career, health preferences, locations — each with a default importance band used at retrieval rank time.

### World Model query result shape

`WorldModelResult` aggregates ranked: projects, decisions, blockers, current work items, graph entities, graph relationships, memories, recent context version diffs — plus a computed confidence score and contributing source list.

---

## 8. Brain Routing & Privacy

Two inference paths coexist by design (ADR-006):

| Path | When | Handles |
|------|------|---------|
| **Local Ollama** | Always available; forced when Local-only | Ambient quick-ask, tool routing, embeddings, fallback chat |
| **opencode proxy** | Default when Local-only off | Deep reasoning, complex multi-step answers |

Tools and embeddings **never** leave the machine. Only assembled conversation context transits to opencode when enabled.

Settings → Privacy → **Local-only** (`pikuSettings.localOnly`) is the single kill switch — persisted, reactive, honored everywhere `isOpencodeBrain()` is checked.

Future: swap opencode for a self-hosted private model without changing routing architecture (model ID stays behind the provider abstraction).

---

## 9. Agent Workflows

Agent mode is not a separate product — it is the **tool-capable control hub** over the same World Model.

**Session model:** Multiple named `AgentContext` records. Each holds ordered turns, optional `projectId`, and a sticky **mode** (`auto`, execute-oriented modes, etc.). Mode detection runs per turn; cleaned message text strips mode prefixes.

**Reasoning visibility:** Complex asks may produce a structured reasoning flow (understand → plan) shown in the live panel before execution. Streaming separates **thinking** tokens from **answer** tokens.

**Tool surface (by capability group):**

| Group | Capabilities |
|-------|--------------|
| OS / Apps | Open/focus apps, open links/paths, list home files |
| Comms | Gmail inbox query, Calendar event query |
| Dev / GitHub | Commits today, list repos, recent activity |
| Web | Search + fetch top results for summarization |
| Memory | Save fact, recall facts, datetime |

Tools execute locally via Ollama tool-calling through ToolRouter. Agent replies enforce **reply discipline** — answer-first, no meta-narration about "the user wants…".

**Automations (partial):** User stores `{ name, instruction, trigger }` in localStorage. Full trigger-phrase → intent matching is planned; capability registry already documents the tool catalog.

---

## 10. Connectors & Observation Loop

**Built connectors:**

- **GitHub** — Multi-account PAT; commits, repos, activity widgets on Work/Home.
- **Gmail** — Google OAuth; inbox widget, `gmail_check` tool.
- **Google Calendar** — Same OAuth family; merged account list; work/personal tagging by email.

**Embedded surfaces:**

- WhatsApp / LinkedIn — Native Tauri child webviews positioned over DOM regions.
- Jira / Confluence / Notion — Open in dedicated Chrome profile (`open_in_piku_chrome`).

**Observation layer (Phase 2 — partially built):**

- Rust **active-app observer** captures foreground app context.
- Currently **dormant** pending a consent UI and a registered `ContextSource` consumer.
- Design rule: new sources implement `ContextSource.register()` — they do not open IndexedDB directly.

---

## 11. Stack (Conceptual)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Shell | **Tauri 2** | Native macOS integration: hotkey overlay, webview embeds, FS/git commands, tray |
| UI | **React 18 + Tailwind** | Component model for dense HUD surfaces; framer-motion for micro-interaction |
| Local inference | **Ollama** | Chat, embeddings, tool-capable small models on-device |
| Deep reasoning | **opencode serve** (optional) | Capable free model via local proxy; not a PIKU-hosted API |
| Persistence | **IndexedDB** (via `idb`) | Versioned schema, portable, no native DB dependency |
| Settings | **localStorage** | Reactive store with env-var defaults |
| Tests | **Vitest + fake-indexeddb** | Graph seed tests, World Model source tests, store round-trips |

No PIKU cloud backend. No Supabase. No server-side RAG index.

---

## 12. Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Local-first architecture

**Status:** Accepted (partially revised by ADR-006)  
**Context:** PIKU must function without internet for retrieval, embeddings, and tools.  
**Decision:** Primary inference runs locally via Ollama.  
**Consequences:** No API cost for local path; capability bounded by local model size; full privacy for on-device turns.

### ADR-002: IndexedDB for storage

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Cross-platform persistence in a Tauri desktop app without native DB bindings.  
**Decision:** Versioned IndexedDB schema (`piku-memory`, currently v8).  
**Consequences:** Portable, good-enough performance; migrations must be non-destructive; no server-side backup unless user exports.

### ADR-003: Knowledge graph for memory

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Structured relationships enable context-aware answers beyond flat fact retrieval.  
**Decision:** TypeScript-native graph with ~9 node types and ~10 relationship types; extraction pipeline populates automatically.  
**Consequences:** Flexible querying; requires extraction quality gates; graph can grow large → clustering needed.

### ADR-004: Hub-and-spoke graph visualization

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Operators need to explore what PIKU knows, not just query it.  
**Decision:** Force-directed layout with "cosmic void" visual theme; galaxy clustering by project.  
**Consequences:** Intuitive browsing; large graphs need clustering performance work.

### ADR-005: nomic-embed-text for embeddings

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Semantic search over memories and graph nodes requires local embeddings.  
**Decision:** Fixed embedding model via Ollama; 768-dimensional vectors.  
**Consequences:** Local, no API cost; model change would invalidate all stored vectors — intentionally not exposed in Settings.

### ADR-006: opencode as the deep-thinking brain (revises ADR-001)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Local 4B model is fast and private but weak on hard reasoning.  
**Decision:** Route conversation/reasoning to a capable free model through local `opencode serve` proxy, with Ollama as automatic fallback. Tools + embeddings stay local.  
**Consequences:** Better reasoning at no direct API cost; conversation context leaves machine by default → mitigated by Settings → Privacy → **Local-only** toggle restoring fully-local operation.

### ADR-007: User-editable settings as source of truth

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Identity, models, privacy, and work links were previously hardcoded or env-only.  
**Decision:** Single persisted reactive store (`pikuSettings` + `useSettings`); defaults from env vars; all consumers read live.  
**Consequences:** Everything changeable from Settings without rebuilds; embedding model excluded by design.

---

## 13. Roadmap & Open Work

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Core chat + graph infrastructure | **Built** |
| 2 | World Model + observation loop | **Built** (observer dormant) |
| 3 | Graph visualization | **In progress** |
| 4 | Vault filesystem + document absorption | Vault concept built; drag-drop pending |
| 5 | Calendar, git, browser integrations | **Built** |
| 6 | Personality-as-data + settings UI | Settings **built**; personality-as-data pending |

**Still open:** embedded PTY terminal · drag-drop dataset ingestion · file preview · pending-update review queue · People relationship timeline · observer consent gate · personality-as-data.

---

## 14. Testing & Quality Posture

- **Unit tests** on graph seed integrity, World Model source scoring, IndexedDB store round-trips, Agent context persistence.
- **Confidence gating** tested at extraction boundary — pending vs confirmed thresholds.
- **Isolation** — World Model source failures are per-source (`Promise.allSettled`); one dead connector does not block retrieval.
- **No production rebuild recipe in this doc** — tests assume local Ollama + dev env; CI posture not yet standardized.

---

## 15. Risks & Trade-offs

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Graph pollution from weak extractions | Pending edge/memory status; confirmed-only retrieval |
| Embedding model lock-in | Documented ADR-005; migration would require re-embed job |
| Cloud brain privacy default | Local-only toggle; clear Settings labeling |
| Large graph render performance | Galaxy clustering; cap nodes in retrieval (top-K) |
| OAuth token rot | Per-connector refresh; reconnect UX in Settings |
| Observer creepiness | Consent gate before any active-app data enters World Model |
